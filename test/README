DDTS Test Suite

Quick Start

  ddts <suite>            : run the suite named <suite>
  ddts baseline <suite>   : run the suite named <suite> & create baseline image
  ddts clean              : remove most test-suite created items
  ddts cleaner            : clean + remove baseline & data archive
  ddts help               : shows this usage information
  ddts run <run>          : perform the single run named <run>
  ddts show run <run>     : show details of the run named <run>
  ddts show runs          : show valid run names
  ddts show suite <suite> : show details for the suite named <suite>
  ddts show suites        : show valid suite names

Baseline Creation / Comparison

  Run 'ddts baseline <suite>' to create a baseline image of the named suite
  ('ddts show suites' lists valid names). A directory named 'baseline' will be
  created in the current directory, and one subdirectory will be created under
  it for each unique 'baseline' value specified in the configs of the suite's
  various runs. These subdirectories must not already exist.

  The test suite will automatically compare its runs' output to the contents of
  the 'baseline' directory if it exists. You may copy or link a previously
  generated baseline directory here.

A useful workflow might consist of these steps:

  1. Check out a fresh working copy.
  2. Run 'ddts baseline <suite>' to generate a baseline.
  3. Make changes to the working copy as needed.
  4. Run 'ddts <suite>' to verify your changes against the baseline.

Logging

  Each 'ddts' invocation that does not fail immediately generates a verbose
  logfile named 'log.timestamp', where timestamp is the seconds-since-epoch
  test-suite start time.
